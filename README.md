## Datset Used
- [Dataset](https://github.com/redwan011235/Excel-Project/blob/main/Dataset.xlsx)
  
## Project requirements
- KPI -1: Calculate the Total Number of Applicants
- KPI -2: Calculate the Total Number of Shortlisted Candidates
- KPI -3: Calculate the Total Number of Offers Provided
- KPI -4: Calculate the Total Number of Hires
- KPI -5: Calculate the Offer Acceptance Rate
- KPI -6: Calculate the Time-to-Hire (Average Days to Fill a Position)
- KPI -7: Calculate the Source-wise Applicant Conversion Rate
- Show the Recruitment Funnel (Applicants ‚Üí Shortlisted ‚Üí Offers ‚Üí Hires)
- Show Department-Wise Recruitment Status (Use Bar Chart)
- Show Job Role-Wise Hiring (Use Column Chart)
- Show Source of Hire Distribution (Use Pie/Donut Chart)
- Show Monthly/Quarterly Hiring Trends (Use Line Chart)
- Show Gender Diversity of Hires (Use Donut Chart)
- Filter/Slicer 1: Department
- Filter/Slicer 2: Job Role
- Filter/Slicer 3: Source of Hire
- Filter/Slicer 4: Time Period (Month/Quarter/Year)

## Process
- Step 1: Collect and clean raw recruitment data (Applicants, Shortlisted, Offers, Hires, Sources, Departments, Job Roles).
- Step 2: Load the dataset into Excel and format it into structured tables.
- Step 3: Use Power Query for data transformation (removing duplicates, handling nulls, standardizing fields).
- Step 4: Build a Data Model linking applicants, offers, hires, and source information.
- Step 5: Create PivotTables for KPIs (Applicants, Shortlisted, Offers, Hires, Conversion Rates, Time-to-Hire).
- Step 6: Design Vacancy Fill Rate Dashboard to track open positions vs. filled positions.
- Step 7: Design Hiring Progress KPI Dashboard to monitor stage-wise progress in the recruitment funnel.
- Step 8: Design HR KPIs Scoreboard with high-level performance indicators (Acceptance Rate, Diversity, Hiring Trends).
- Step 9: Add charts (Funnel, Bar, Column, Donut, Line, Tree Map) to visualize recruitment metrics.
- Step 10: Add Slicers/Filters for Department, Job Role, Source of Hire, and Timeline.
- Step 11: Apply conditional formatting and KPI cards for better readability.
- Step 12: Test the dashboard for accuracy, interactivity, and usability.

## Project Insights

- Insight -1: A total of 3,000 applications were received, of which 253 were hired ‚Üí Overall Hire Rate = 8.4%.

- Insight -2: 628 offers were made and 386 were accepted, but only 253 joined ‚Üí Offer-to-Hire conversion = 40%, indicating a joining gap.

- Insight -6: The Offer Acceptance Rate is 61.5%, below industry benchmarks ‚Üí signals the need to strengthen employer branding and candidate engagement.

- Insight -7: Peak applications were observed in a specific month, reflecting seasonal recruitment trends.

- Insight -8: Diversity Insight ‚Äì While female candidates are present in the pipeline, their offer-to-hire conversion is lower, showing the need to strengthen the female hiring pipeline.

 ## üèÅ Conclusion
The HR Recruitment Dashboard successfully transforms raw recruitment data into actionable insights. It highlights key hiring metrics, identifies bottlenecks in the recruitment pipeline, and uncovers opportunities such as improving referral programs, enhancing employer branding, and addressing gender diversity gaps.
